# Tyler + Stephon Tutoring

Every Sunday from 2 - 4 pm we will meet at the slalom office (180 N Stetson Ave) and work through different programming exercises. The general structure of these sessions will consist of a short lecture followed by pair programming for various exercises. The goal of these sessions is to:

  - Help you understand the fundamentals of web development
  - Learn the languages of web development (html, css, js)
  - Learn about the tools that developers use to build apps

We will continue these sessions on a weekly basis and by the end of them you should have a good understanding of the various technologies and tools that are used when making a web app.
